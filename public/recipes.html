        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <p>This is the 1886 Pemberton Coke recipe.</p>

        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <p>He said that real coke tastes more artificial, more cokey, and less sweet. He also said they taste very similar. Again, this is the flavorlab recipe. Interesting.</p>

        <p>Burnt Caramel Sryup, Light Caramel Syrup, lots of sugar syrup, no cinnamon, bit of bay leaf, tiny bit of orange, some green tea, tartaric acid, no citric acid</p>
        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <p>They taste pretty close and this is a bit less sweet than coke. It's a bit more acidic but it tastes like a "cola".</p>

            Squozen: Tastes like a nice cola but doesn't taste like coke. Cube cola method is good.
